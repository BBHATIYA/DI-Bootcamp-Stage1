        <strong class="p-title"> Reactions to the executions:</strong> The
        Tribune news report of Sardar Bhagat Singh's execution,1931. The
        executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took
        place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party at
        Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who
        shouted "Down with Gandhi". The New York Times reported: A reign of
        terror in the city of Cawnpore in the United Provinces and an attack on
        Mahatma Gandhi by a youth outside Karachi were among the answers of the
        Indian extremists today to the hanging of Bhagat Singh and two
        fellow-assassins. Hartals and strikes of mourning were called. The
        Congress party, during the Karachi session, declared: While dissociating
        itself from and disapproving of political violence in any shape or form,
        this Congress places on record its admiration of the bravery and
        sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukh Dev and Raj Guru and mourns with their
        bereaved families the loss of these lives. The Congress is of the
        opinion that their triple execution was an act of wanton vengeance and a
        deliberate flouting of the unanimous demand of the nation for
        commutation. This Congress is further of the opinion that the [British]
        Government lost a golden opportunity for promoting good-will between the
        two nations, admittedly held to be crucial at this juncture, and for
        winning over to methods of peace a party which, driven to despair,
        resorts to political violence. In the issue of Young India of 29 March
        1931, Gandhi wrote: Bhagat Singh and his two associates have been
        hanged. The Congress made many attempts to save their lives and the
        Government entertained many hopes of it, but all has been in a vain.
        Bhagat Singh did not wish to live. He refused to apologise, or even file
        an appeal. Bhagat Singh was not a devotee of non-violence, but he did
        not subscribe to the religion of violence. He took to violence due to
        helplessness and to defend his homeland. In his last letter, Bhagat
        Singh wrote, " I have been arrested while waging a war. For me there can
        be no gallows. Put me into the mouth of a cannon and blow me off." These
        heroes had conquered the fear of death. Let us bow to them a thousand
        times for their heroism. But we should not imitate their act. In our
        land of millions of destitute and crippled people, if we take to the
        practice of seeking justice through murder, there will be a terrifying
        situation. Our poor people will become victims of our atrocities. By
        making a dharma of violence, we shall be reaping the fruit of our own
        actions. Hence, though we praise the courage of these brave men, we
        should never countenance their activities. Our dharma is to swallow our
        anger, abide by the discipline of non-violence and carry out our duty.
